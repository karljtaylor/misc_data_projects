In the case of the -1, it seems very likely that this could be an issue related to the database, and since one of the conclusions we draw is that having child==increased default risk, this is probably worth scrutinizing. One thing I did earlier on and ended up deleting was using median instead of mean, but I realized that since our measurement is on a 0-1 default rate, the median would hide more information than it would share. happy to rethink this if needed, but that's sort of what my frame of thought was</span>\n",

    "First, we counted people who had -1 children in with individuals who had 0 children. One possible reason for this is that individuals with negative children are likely to currently not be raising children, like the respondants with 0 children. Another likely explanation might be an issue with the database we got the data from. We should follow up our analysis by further scrutinizing the data. It is possible, for example, that these respondents may have 1 child, and the 47 rows have an error. If this is the case it will skew out analysis! In the case of 20 children, while this number is large, it may not necessarily be invalid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, reading through the income ranges one entry at a time wouldn't be particularly informative, and likely wouldn't have shed any actionable insight on our data, so we created a function to group the total_income column into a few predifned ranges. At smaller incomes, we used a smaller range, as the impact of additional income is likely to have a greater impact on the default rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, answering the questions below will require us to know a lot about what conditions result in a higher risk of default. In order to accomplish this comparison, we calculated a baseline default rate by performing calculations on our dataset. "

That is very pleased - met project structure, the steps of the job identified and executed sequentially, the code is written carefully, use code comments, you can quickly understand which operation to perform complex design, variable names convey the meaning of the operations. As a tip, I suggest that you study the try-except construction more thoroughly and start applying it to solve the problem.
